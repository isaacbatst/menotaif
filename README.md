## The project

Me Nota IF calculates your grades and helps you to know if your working hard or not.

The goal here is to reach IFRN students that need to calculate their grades on the Web.

## Dev

Hey, this is a conventional React APP bootstrapped with... [CREATE REACT APP](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Sooo... in the project directory, you can run all that stuff:

### `yarn start`
### `yarn test`
### `yarn build`

Take a look at package.json and Create React App docs to know more.
